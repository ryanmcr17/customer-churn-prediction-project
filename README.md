# Customer Churn Prediction (Project 4 / Final Project)

## For this project I plan to work on customer churn/retention analysis and prediction, specific to banking customers. I will analyze trends and relationships between specific customer details/features and customer churn outcomes, and will also build a model to try to predict whether or not those customers would continue to stay with the bank. The dataset I currently plan to work with contains many customer details/features including age, tenure as a customer, geographic location, credit scores, account balances, number of banking products used/purchased, etc.

### Dataset: This dataset from Kaggle provides a number of relevant data points on banking customers from which to predict the likelihood of those customers churning /leaving the bank, as well as whether or not each customer did actually leave: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/churn-for-bank-customers
